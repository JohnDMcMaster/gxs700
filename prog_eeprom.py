'''
with the bad eeprom connected it didn't register sensor ID
however it did still do state probes
does this mean that it would continue to work even with a wiped eeprom?
how did I wipe it?

What is EEPROM1?
Could it be an FPGA and the bitstream is no longer loading?
Think its a SmartFusion
could be talking to an ARM/FPGA over SPI or something like that
what could cause it to stop booting?
Is there a mode pin I set?
Wrote a bad register to it?
 

eeprom1
    read:  controlRead( 0xC0, 0xB0, 0x0010
    write: 
eeprom2
    read:  controlRead( 0xC0, 0xB0, 0x000B
    write: controlWrite(0x40, 0xB0, 0x000C
